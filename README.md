# About

This is a hobby project that I have created to learn how to set up a server using C\#.  
The initial goal was to use it as a API server for a webapp and mobile app.  
During the project, I discovered that you would want to create an API project to do this.
So, now it is just a basic HTTP server.

# Status

This project is now closed.
